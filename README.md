# Control Systems Fundamentals

Welcome to the Control Systems Fundamentals repository!  
This repository contains all MATLAB codes for a complete step-by-step series on understanding and simulating control systems, from first-order systems to compensator design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Series Overview

This series is designed to teach you:

1. First-Order Systems
   - Step and impulse responses
   - Effect of time constant on system dynamics

2. Second-Order Systems
   - Underdamped, overdamped, critically damped responses
   - Effect of damping ratio and natural frequency
   - Step and impulse responses

3. Poles and Zeros
   - How pole and zero locations affect time responses
   - Visualizing system behavior

4. Frequency Response & Stability
   - Bode plots
   - Nyquist plots
   - Gain and phase margins
   - Routh-Hurwitz criterion

5. Compensator Design
   - Lead, Lag, and Lead-Lag compensators
   - Practical MATLAB examples for improving system performance


## ðŸ–¥ How to Run the Codes

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the folder of the specific topic.
3. Open the desired .m file.
4. Run the script and observe the plots.
